# parlvid.mysociety.org

Basic configuration for parlvid.mysociety.org where we used to host flash video of debates from the the UK Parliament.

Since [Flash reached end-of-life in 2020](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) and is no longer supported, we don't host these videos any more.

However we do still host our [cache of OS, ONS, and OSNI open data](https://parlvid.mysociety.org/os/).
